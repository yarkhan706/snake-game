# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in JavaScript using HTML5 canvas for rendering.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.
2. The snake will begin moving to the right automatically.
3. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to change the snake's direction.
4. The goal is to eat the red food that appears randomly on the board to grow the snake.
5. Each time the snake eats food, your score will increase by 1.
6. The game ends when the snake hits the edge of the game board or collides with itself.
7. You can reset the game by clicking the "RESET" button.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the game layout and elements.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the game container, score text, and reset button.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic, including movement, food generation, and collision detection.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior of the game by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file. Additionally, you can adjust the game's logic in the `index.js` file to change the movement speed, board size, or scoring system.
